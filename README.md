Goose is a minimalistic migration framework that has no opinions on how you should migrate, it only provides a structure to do so.

You can use Goose wherever you want, with whatever you want. Whether that's [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) with [Isar](https://isar.dev) or [Dart Frog](https://dartfrog.vgv.dev) with [Hive](https://pub.dev/packages/hive) or X with Y, this silly goose can do it all!

It comes with the following features:

- 🚀 Migrating up or down using a programmable API
- 🧑‍💻 Platform agnostic, use any database or system you prefer
- 🙅 Zero dependencies and therefore zero headaches
- 🪿 A silly Goose
