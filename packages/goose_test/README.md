A testing library which makes it easy to test migrations. Built to be used with the [Goose migration package](https://pub.dev/packages/goose).

## Installation

Add `goose_test` as a dev dependency to your pubspec.yaml file ([what?](https://flutter.io/using-packages/)).

You can then import Goose Test in your test file:

```dart
import 'package:goose_test/goose_test.dart';
```

## Using `testMigration`

`testMigration` creates a new `migration`-specific test case with the given `description`. `testMigration` will handle running the migration's up and down methods. `testMigration` also ensures that the migration will always happen in the order of `up` first and then try revert through the `down` method to ensure that the migration can be reverted.

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `create`  | Should create and return the `migration` that is to be tested. |
| `setupUp` | An optional callback which is invoked before the `migration`'s `up` is called and can be used for setting up the migration's required data for the `up` migration. For common set up code, prefer to use `setUp` from `package:test/test.dart`. |
| `verifyUp` | An optional callback which is invoked after the `migration`'s `up` was called and can be used for additional verification/assertions. `verifyUp` is called with the `migration` returned by `create`. |
| `setupDown` | An optional callback which is invoked before the `migration`'s `down` is called and can be used for setting up the migration's required data for the `down` migration. For common set up code, prefer to use `setUp` from `package:test/test.dart`. |
| `verifyDown` | An optional callback which is invoked after the `migration`'s `down` was called and can be used for additional verification/assertions. `verifyDown` is called with the `migration` returned by `create`. |
| `tags` | An optional argument and if it is passed, it declares user-defined tags that are applied to the test. These tags can be used to select or skip the test on the command line, or to do bulk test configuration. |

```dart
import 'package:goose/goose.dart';
import 'package:goose_test/goose_test.dart';
import 'package:test/test.dart';

class MyMigration extends Migration {
  MyMigration(this.storage)
      : super('my_migration', description: 'A simple migration');

  final Map<String, dynamic> storage;

  @override
  Future<void> down() async => storage.clear();

  @override
  Future<void> up() async => storage['migrated'] = true;
}

void main() {
  group('MyMigration', () {
    late Map<String, dynamic> storage;
    setUp(() => storage = {});

    testMigration(
      'executes correctly',
      create: () => MyMigration(storage),
      verifyUp: (_) => expect(storage['migrated'], isTrue),
      verifyDown: (_) => expect(storage.isEmpty, isTrue),
    );
  });
}
```
